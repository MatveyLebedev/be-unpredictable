# be-unpredictable
This AI based game shows that predicting human behavior is much easier than you might have thought.

In this app a neuron net starts training every time you restart the game.

Try to be more unpredictable for the neural network.
Every time when you push a button, the app shows its prediction for this step (the net does not know your latest choice).
Color gradient shows how many times you pushed each button. The darker the button is the less often you pushed it. Your total score is calculated as the number of steps divided by the number of times when the neural network guessed correctly.

You can run tkinter or kivy realization, also it needs python3 and tensorflow.
